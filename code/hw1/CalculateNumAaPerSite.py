# This script will read in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in a

# of sites in the alignment with a specific number of         
# alternative amino acids / nucleotides.

# as an excel sheet where alignment[1,:] would be the entirety of row 2. In
# this way we can access any element of the alignment. I recommend reading
